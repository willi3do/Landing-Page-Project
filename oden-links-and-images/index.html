        <!--An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element’s opening tag. An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all attributes require a value. In our case, we need to add an href (hypertext reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to.-->
        <!--the <a> "anchor tag"  element can run links by itself needs the <href> "Hyper" to know where to open the link-->
        <!--It’s worth noting you can use anchor tags to link to any kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents.-->

            <!--This attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.

            The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.

            The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.-->
